Create kernel density estimates, one for each type of crime. Over the full year. Learn a linear model that is a weighted combination of these.
Try doing a 3D kernel density estimate. (including time)

Do spatial-temporal hawkes process.

What about adding in time ....

```{r}
data = read.table("/home/finn/phd/data/geocoded_clean.txt",sep="\t",header=TRUE)
data = data[,c('lon','lat','day','dow','month','hourofday','crime_trunk')]
```
